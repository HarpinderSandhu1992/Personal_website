    <p class="aboutme">I was born in Southampton, England. Having graduated university with a Bachelors Degree in Business IT, I pursued a career in the retail sector, with my family businesses. I moved to Vancouver, Canada a couple of years ago. After getting married there, I again moved, this time to Airdrie, Canada. Here I am looking to pursue a career in Web Development.</p>
